The Java Iterable interface is used for handling collection objects.

Hierarchy of the Iterable interface.

    -Collection***
         -List***
            -ArrayList+
            -LinkedList+
         -Queue***
            -PriorityQueue+
         -Set***
            -HashSet+

Classes are: ArrayList, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, and HashSet

About Iterable interface.
    We care about providing foreach looping functionality for Generic classes built with arrays/collection internally.
    Generic class must implement the Iterable interface and provide implementation for the iterator method that returns the iterator object.
    Iterator object is needed for performing foreach looping.
    Foreach looping can be achieved using a while-loop(genericObject.hasNext()) and genericObject.next() to retrieve item in current index location.
    It can also be achieved using just for(var item in genericObject) simply.


About Collection interface
    This interface is only interested in adding and removing items in a collection object.
    Since it implements the Iterable interface, it means foreach loop can be used to iterate the collection object.
    Avoid creating a class that implements the Collection interface, because you will have to implement several required methods (those defined in the Iterable interface as well as those defined in the Collection interface).
    Rather, use the Collection interface and any of its implementing classes such as ArrayList, PriorityQueue, HashSet etc. to create an instance of a collection object.
    You can loop the collectionObject using foreach loop, or simply use an iterator object in a while-loop to achieve same result.
    To get iterator do, "return Arrays.stream(collectionObject).iterator()"

About List interface
    This interface is interested in using index to access item in a collection.
    If you care about the index or position of items in an ordered collection, then use the List interface.
    Also, since the List interface implements the Collection, it means it will be able to do everything that the Collection interface and Iterable interface can do.
    So you can use a foreach or iterator object to loop through the collection (Thanks to Iterable interface)
    You can also add, remove, get size of the collection (Thanks to Collection interface)
