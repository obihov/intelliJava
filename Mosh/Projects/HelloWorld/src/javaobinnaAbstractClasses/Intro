You can not instantiate an abstract class.

However, you can create an array object off an abstract class.
Just keep in mind that for each item, it has to be subclass of the abstract class.

So you have
abstract class Student{ }
class GradStudent extends Student { }

You cannot instantiate Student since it's abstract so below wont work
Student student = new Student();

But you can create an array of Student even if it's abstract. Can do the same with interfaces as well.
Student[] students = new Student[2];

If you noticed, arrays are recognizable through its square brackets and not the round brackets used in
instantiating a class.

To add item to the abstract student array object, you must use a subclass of the abstract class that is
in itself instantiable. So,
students[0] = new GradStudent()

This is like saying,
Student student = new GradStudent();
